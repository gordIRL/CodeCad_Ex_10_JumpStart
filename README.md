# CodeCad_Ex_10_JumpStart

An assignment website for my CodeCademy webdeveloper course.
Developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery - we were given images and a brief we had to emulate.

(design driven assignment - zoom on images when mouse hovers, buttons move user to a another page segment, 
some links are purely aesthetic and etc provide no functionality)

# CodeCad_Ex_10_JumpStart

An assignment website for my CodeCademy 'Web Developer Ready' course.
Developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery - we were given images and a brief we had to emulate.

(A design driven assignment - zoom on images when mouse hovers, elements on page adjust to the user's screen size,
buttons move user to a another page segment, some links are for purely aesthetic purposes and provide no functionality)
